● What is JSX?

JSX is Javascript XML. This is HTML like syntax which we write in react code. JSX is not readily understood by 
react. However, parcel delegates the job of converting JSX code to react.createElement to babel. 
i.e., babel transpiler converts the JSX to react.createElement which in turn creates a react element 
which is a normal JS object. And we all know this react element is converted HTML tag by render function.


● Superpowers of JSX
It is a HTML like code we write in react. 
Our code is readable because we use JSX. 
We can write Javascript code inside JSX using {}. Because of this there are chances of malicious attacks like
CROSS SITE SCRIPTING. Our JSX automatically takes care of this cross-site scripting attack (sanitizes the JS code.).

● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

type attribute has following options:
1. no attribute (default) 
2. text/javascript
3. importmap
4. module
5. speculationrules

Note:
One important point here is that, we cannot do export or import in browser scripts.
And our app.js file is not browser script. Therefore, we need to use type = "module" in script tag.


● {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

These are the three ways we can write to use a component in our code.
