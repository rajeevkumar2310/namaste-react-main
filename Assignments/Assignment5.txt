Assignment
● What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?

- Named export 

While exporting we can write export directly before the variable or component which needs to be exported.
or we can export at the end of the document using {}.
ex: export const LOGO_URL 
or export {LOGO_URL}

While importing we need to import using {}
ex: import {LOGO_URL} from "./utils/constants";

- Default export

while exporting we can export as under:
export default Header;

While importing, we can import without using {}.
import Header from "./components/Header";

Since it was a default export of the header.js file, while we import we can use any name. Not just Header.
It can be: 
import Head from "./components/Header";


- * as export/import

When there are multiple exports. There can be only one DEFAULT EXPORT and multiple named exports. In that case, 
we can use:
import * as Head from "./components/Header" and while using them, we can write 
Head.default, {Head.NamedComponent1}, {Head.NamedComponent2}, {Head.NamedComponent3}.
